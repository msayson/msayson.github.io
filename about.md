My name is Mark Sayson, and I'm a software developer based in Seattle, WA, USA, with a focus on developing distributed backend services.

I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at Amazon, leading and collaborating on cross-team initiatives to automate company-wide security and consumer privacy.

Principles I strive to live by:
* Always be learning and taking on new challenges.
* Be an effective and dependable member of any team.
* Listen to team members, partners, and customers, and help them succeed.
* Understand the "why" before diving into the "how" to ensure we're solving the right problem.
* Have a positive impact.

I enjoy learning and exploring new ideas, and spending free time with my wife and daughter, reading, and playing and teaching the strategic board game Go.
